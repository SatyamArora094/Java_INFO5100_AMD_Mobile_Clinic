# _Hospital On Wheels_


Mobile Clinic System was a project that I developed during my Application Modelling and Design course at Northeastern University.

A hospital on wheels is a mobile van administered by the NU Nursing School that travels between cities to take care of high-risk patients. The primary goal is to monitor and control the spread of infectious diseases among this high-risk group. Nursing professors and students make up the new mobile clinical team. When the team opens up shop in different areas, they accept patients on a first-come, first-served basis. The patient is then examined by a nurse, the major complaint is noted, vital signs are collected, a diagnosis is made, lab tests are submitted to the lab, and incidents of contagious disease are recorded. All events must be planned ahead of time and linked to a funding campaign.
